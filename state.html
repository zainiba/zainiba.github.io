      <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        I am an interdisciplinary artist. I enjoy working in sculpture and digital media and try to combine the two forms whenever possible. I gather inspiration from my everyday life and from things we are so accustomed to seeing that they get
        ignored. It can be unnoticed transitions of the land around us or customarily ignored in-your-face ads.
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        My art takes an approach of critiquing and creating parallels of societal norms. In Meditate with Me, I put spiritual concepts in a technological space giving users a chance to combine the two practices (meditating online).
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        An appreciation of how things build up or change over time is also seen in my various works. Drowning, is an animation compilation of my emotions over the period of a semester. In Google Stalks Me with My Permission, using my personal
        location tracking data from Google maps I laser cut the map routes into plywood and then, I used epoxy to map out my most frequent routes.
